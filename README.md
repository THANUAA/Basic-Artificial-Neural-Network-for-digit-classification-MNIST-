# Basic-Artificial-Neural-Network-for-digit-classification-MNIST-
Digit Classifier Web App using ANN + React This project builds and deploys a full-stack digit recognition system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can draw a digit on the React frontend and get predictions from a Flask backend powered by a trained Keras model.
